Transfer hierarchy
==================

Service		org.openobex.client
Interface	org.openobex.Transfer
Object path	[variable prefix]/{transfer0,transfer1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the transfer. See the
			properties section for available properties.

Properties	string Name [read-only]

			Name of the transferred object.

		uint64 Size [read-only]

			Size of the transferred object. If the size is
			unknown, then this property will not be present.


Agent hierarchy
===============

Service		unique name
Interface	org.openobex.Agent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release()

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
			agent, because when this method gets called it has
			already been unregistered.

		string Request(object transfer)

			Accept or reject a new transfer (client and server)
			and provide the filename for it.

			In case of incoming transfers it is the filename
			where to store the file and for outgoing transfers
			it is the filename to show the remote device. If left
			empty it will be calculated automatically.

			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.Rejected
			                 org.openobex.Error.Canceled

		void Progress(object transfer, uint64 transferred)

			Progress within the transfer has been made. The
			number of transferred bytes is given as second
			argument for convenience.
